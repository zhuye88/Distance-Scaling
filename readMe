Abstract of the paper

Density-based clustering is able to find clusters of arbitrary sizes and shapes while effectively separating noise. Despite its 
advantage over other types of clustering, it is well-known that most density-based algorithms face the same challenge of finding 
clusters with varied densities. Recently, ReScale, a principled density-ratio preprocessing technique, enables a density-based 
clustering algorithm to identify clusters with varied densities. However, because the technique is based on one-dimensional 
scaling, it does not do well in datasets which require multi-dimensional scaling. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional 
scaling method, named DScale, which rescales based on the computed distance. It overcomes the key weakness of ReScale and 
requires one less parameter while maintaining the simplicity of the implementation. Our empirical evaluation shows that DScale 
has better clustering performance than ReScale for three existing density-based algorithms, i.e., DBSCAN, OPTICS and DP, on 
synthetic and real-world datasets.
